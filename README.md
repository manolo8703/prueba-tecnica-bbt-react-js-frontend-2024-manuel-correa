## Welcome to my technical test

Here you will find everything you need to start the project in your local environment. Please read the following steps carefully to complete this task.

1. **Node.js:** You need to have Node.js version v18.13.0 or preferably higher.
2. **Vite.js:** You also need to have the latest version of Vite.js if you wish to make changes to the app.
3. **Clone the Repository:** You must clone this repository to your local environment. The repository has two branches: 
   - `main`: Contains the latest changes.
   - `dev`: The development branch.
       4. **Project Directory:** Once you have completed the installation, you should enter the `prueba-tecnica-season-fruits` directory. In this directory, you will find all the necessary files for the project to be executed from this directory.
       5. **Running the Project:**
   - **Development Mode:** Run the command `npm run dev` in your terminal and go to the local address shown.
