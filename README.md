<h2>
Welcome to my technical test. Here you will find everything you need to start the project in your local environment. Please read the following steps carefully to complete this task.
</h2> 
<br>
<b>1.</b> You need to have Node.js version v18.13.0 or preferably higher.
<br>
<b>2.</b> You also need to have the latest version of Vite.js if you wish to make changes to the app.
<br>
<b>3.</b> You must clone this repository to your local environment. The repository has two branches: the main branch, which is 'main' and contains the latest changes, and 'dev', which is the development branch.
<br>
<b>4.</b> Once you have completed the installation, you should enter the "prueba-tecnica-season-fruits" directory. In this directory, you will find all the necessary files for the project to be executed from this directory.
<br>
<b>5.</b> To run the project in development mode, you should run the command `npm run dev` in your terminal and go to the local address shown. To run the project in production mode, you should run the command `npm run build`.
<br>

Thank you very much for your attention.
